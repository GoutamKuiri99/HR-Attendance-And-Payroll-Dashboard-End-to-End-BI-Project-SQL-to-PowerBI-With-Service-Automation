## 🚨 Business Problem

In a rapidly growing organization, the HR department was struggling with multiple challenges that impacted efficiency and accuracy:

- **Attendance Tracking Errors**: Manual attendance registers and outdated systems led to frequent mismatches and inaccuracies in employee presence data.
- **Salary Miscalculations**: Due to inconsistent data sources and lack of automation, payroll processing often resulted in errors — causing employee dissatisfaction and rework.
- **Manual Payroll Processing**: A significant portion of time and effort was spent on preparing monthly salary sheets, calculating deductions, and generating payslips.
- **Lack of Centralized HR Reporting**: With data scattered across Excel files and departmental records, the HR and Finance teams lacked a unified platform to monitor key metrics like attendance trends, leave patterns, and payroll costs.

These problems not only slowed down operations but also hampered data-driven decision-making. There was a pressing need for a centralized, automated, and interactive BI solution to streamline HR processes, reduce errors, and empower stakeholders with real-time insights.
